# Aberration Guesser

## General Concept

Aberration Guesser is a tool designed to "gamify" the process of identifying aberrations in optical systems. It helps reinforce the user's understanding of **wavefront aberration plots** and **transverse ray error plots**.

Aberrations are generally depicted using one of these two types of plots, which are mathematically related:

- A transverse ray error plot is a scaled derivative of the wavefront aberration plot.

### Wavefront Aberration Formula
The wavefront aberration is described by the following formula, where the coefficients \( w \) determine the magnitude of each aberration:

### Transverse Ray Error Formula
This is derived (though not exactly) from the wavefront aberration formula. The coefficients ùúé represent the magnitude of each aberration:
